CHANGELOG
=========

v0.1.3 (2019-12-09):
	Fixes:

	* Checkout no longer errors when there are ID + 10 saved branches.
	* Drop no longer drops both ID and ID + 10 when there are ID + 10 saved
	  branches.
	* Add Bash completion for the `clear` subcommand.

v0.1.2 (2019-05-25):
	Fixes:

	* Allow branch list to be used in subdirectories of a Git repo.
	* Update help output to show the `clear` command and that `drop` can take
	  multiple arguments.

v0.1.1 (2018-04-19):
	Fixes:

	* Prevent `drop` from removing all branches matching the same pattern.
	* Match whole instead of partial branch names in `save` to prevent an error
	  when trying to save different branches with similar names.
	* Fix `drop` bug that prevented branches containing slashes ("/") from being
	  dropped.

v0.1.0 (2018-03-21):
	Additions:

	* New `clear` subcommand drops all saved branches.
	* The `drop` subcommand now accepts multiple arguments, enabling deletion of
	  several saved branches at once.
	* New TAP test suite with tests for the `drop` and `clear` subcommands.

v0.0.1 (2018-02-21):
	Initial release.
